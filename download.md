Ceylon is not yet released to the public. We're working as hard as we can to 
get the first milestone into your hands.

The first milestone will consist of:

* A command-line compiler for Ceylon which implements a *subset* of the 
  language described in the language specification.
* An Eclipse plugin which uses the same compiler backend and provide a number
  of great development features.

You can follow our progress:

* in our [blog](/blog)
* or check out our [roadmap page](/documentation/roadmap).
