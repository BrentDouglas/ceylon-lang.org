Ceylon is not yet released to the public. We're [working as hard as we can](/code/activity) 
to get the [first milestone](/documentation/roadmap#milestone_1) into your 
hands.

However, the code is already available at [GitHub](http://github.com/ceylon).
Adventurous? [Check it out](/code).

The first milestone will have:

* a command-line compiler for Ceylon which implements a *subset* of the 
  language described in the language specification,
* a full-featured Eclipse plugin built around the compiler's type analyzer,
  and
* the first draft of the language module, which includes the basic types
  mentioned in the language specification.

You can follow our progress on:

* our [blog](/blog), or
* the [roadmap](/documentation/roadmap).

Now, shhh, we're kinda breaking the rules here: if you *really* want to try
out Ceylon now, before we even release Milestone 1, you can get a special
pre-release build of the [Ceylon IDE](/documentation/ide).
