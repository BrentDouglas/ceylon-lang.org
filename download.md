Ceylon is not yet released to the public. We're working as hard as we can to 
get the first milestone into your hands.

The first milestone will have:

* a command-line compiler for Ceylon which implements a *subset* of the 
  language described in the language specification,
* a full-featured Eclipse plugin built around the compiler's type analyzer,
  and
* the first draft of the language module, which includes the basic types
  mentioned in the language specification.

You can follow our progress on:

* our [blog](/blog), or
* the [roadmap](/documentation/roadmap).
