Flavio is a Java programmer since the early days. He's worked with almost all 
the frameworks you can find out there. Bored with enterprise application 
programing, tired of being called JEE "architect", he joined Ceylon team looking 
for something really exciting to work on. He is from Argentina and currently lives 
in Prague.
