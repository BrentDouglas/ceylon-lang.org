Ceylon is not yet released to the public. We're working as hard as we can to 
get the first milestone into your hands.

You can follow our progress on:

* our [blog](/blog), or
* the [roadmap](/documentation/roadmap).

## Contributing to Ceylon

Are you interested in joining the team and helping improve the Ceylon language, 
the compiler, the class libraries, or the IDE? If so, contact Gavin on 
[Google +](https://plus.google.com/105743409453530897815) or send him an 
email (`gavin` at `hibernate.org`).

## Contributing to the website

This website, like the rest of Ceylon, is open source. Help us improve it.
We have a complete guide to [contributing to the website](/code/website).
