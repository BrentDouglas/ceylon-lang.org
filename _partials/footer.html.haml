        [How to build the site](/documentation/build-site)
        
        You can find two sample files for [.md](/md-sample) and 
        [.html.haml](/haml-sample) syntaxes. Look at them esp the .md file as it 
        shows how a page should be written and how to use syntax highlighting.          
        Don't yell at me on color / style, this work
        has not been done yet.
        
        The menu is in `_layout/default.html.haml`. Note that none of the pages
        are created yet and that the menu list is a sample.
        
        When you create a page, give it the right metadata:
        
        * layout (use `layout: default` unless you know what to do)
        * title
        * author
        * tab: this is the tab that will be highlighted when the page is shown. Use the lower case menu name.

          * Blog module
          * rewrite menu module to use a .yaml file and a loop for auto generation
